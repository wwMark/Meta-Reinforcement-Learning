In this section, we provide some fundamental knowledge for ease of understanding the algorithms discussed in the following sections.
\subsection{Formulation of Reinforcement Learning and Meta Learning}
In reinforcement learning, a value function \[G_t = \]
no predefined value function is provided to tell the score of an action. In practice, a proxy of the true value function, known as a \textit{return},  is used for estimation and optimization for the value function.
