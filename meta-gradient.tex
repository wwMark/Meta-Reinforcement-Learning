One of the algorithm in meta reinforcement learning is the meta-gradient reinforcement learning introduced in \cite{meta-gradient} by Google DeepMind. This algorithm treats the discount factor $\gamma$ and the bootstrapping parameter $\lambda$, which are discussed in section \rom{2}, as meta-parameter $\eta = \{\gamma, \lambda\}$ to tune the return function.
