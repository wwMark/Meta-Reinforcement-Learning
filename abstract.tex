Meta reinforcement learning is a research area of reinforcement learning. It applies meta learning approaches on reinforcement learning tasks to generalize the training result of reinforcement learning and adapt it to unseen tasks. Currently, multiple meta reinforcement learning methodologies are being researched, such as optimization-based approach, hyperparameter-based approach and so on. In this report, we first provide some fundamental knowledge about meta reinforcement learning. Then we give an overview of state-of-the-art meta reinforcement learning algorithms. Finally, a couple of algorithms are discussed in detail and their experimental results are also presented.\par
