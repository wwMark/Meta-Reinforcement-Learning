Meta reinforcement learning is a research area that combines reinforcement learning and meta learning. It applies meta learning approaches on reinforcement learning tasks to generalize the training result of reinforcement learning and adapts it to unseen tasks. In this report, we provide some fundamental knowledge about meta reinforcement learning. Then we discuss a couple of algorithms in detail and show their experimental results.\par
